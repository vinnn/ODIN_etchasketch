##### detailed scope

###### Create 16 x 16 grid of square divs
- using js
- inside a div container in html
- make the divs appear as a grid using either:
try: float/clear,  inline-block,  flexbox,  CSS Grid

###### Setup a "hover" effect
- grid div change color, leaving pixelated trail as a pen would
- can change color: add a new class, or changing the div's background color with js

###### Add a button
- that will clear the current grid
- and send a popup asking the number of squares per side for the new grid
- new grid should be created in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide)
- set the limit for the user input to a max of 100 squares per side which is reasonable
- for example, should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid popup without changing the total amout of pixels used
